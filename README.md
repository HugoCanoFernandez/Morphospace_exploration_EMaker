This repository contains the scripts necessary to replicate most of the simulations presented in the article 
"A morphospace exploration using a mathematical model of development reveals some possible morphologies of early multicellular animals."

The directory named EmbryoMaker includes the most updated version of the model EmbryoMaker
The directories Figure 7 and Figure 8 include the initial conditions of the simulations presented in the corresponding figures sof the article
The directiories IC1, IC2 and IC3 include the scripts needed to repicate the ensembles of simulations that we performed from each one of those initial conditions (described in the article). Each directory has its own readme with more instructions.
